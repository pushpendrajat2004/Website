# Photos go here — all of them, in this one folder

No sub-folders. Drop every photo straight into `public/assets/images/` using the
filename from the table below.

## How to add or change a photo

1. Find the filename in the table.
2. Save your photo into this folder with **exactly that name**.
3. Refresh the browser. Done.

You never open a React file to change a photo.

Until a file exists, the site shows a styled "Image — to be added" card with the
filename printed on it, so you always know what is missing. Nothing breaks and
there is never a broken-image icon.

## Formats and sizes

`.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp` and `.avif` all work. WebP is smallest — use it if you
can. If you save as `.webp` instead of `.jpg`, change that one extension in
`src/data/images.js`.

## Naming rules

Lowercase, hyphens, and say what the photo is.

Good: `event-fashion-night.jpg`, `reverie-gallery-04.jpg`
Bad: `IMG_1234.jpg`, `DSC_8291.jpg`, `photo1.jpg`, `final-new-2.png`

Filenames are case-sensitive once the site is live on GitHub Pages, even if they
are not on your computer. Keep everything lowercase.
